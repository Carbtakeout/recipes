    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons Lemon Zest, 1 lemon
            <li>1 cup Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Unsalted Butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1 large Egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Lemon Juice, from 1 to 2 lemons</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Baking Powder</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Powdered Sugar</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a food processor, or the bowl of a stand mixer, mix together the sugar and lemon zest until well combined and the sugar is lightly yellow and fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the softened butter to the sugar and mix until light and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Add the vanilla, egg, and lemon juice and mix well, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
    <li>Add the salt, baking powder, baking soda and flour and mix until combined.</li>
    <li>Chill the dough for one hour. If your butter was really warm to start, chill for 2 hours. The butter should be soft enough to cream, but not so soft that if you pressed your finger against the side, it slides right through.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C</li>
    <li>Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside</li>
    <li>Roll the cookie dough into tablespoon sized balls, roll them in powdered sugar and place them 2 inches apart on the baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake for 10-11 minutes or until they are just starting to brown on the edges and are no longer shiny.<strong>Do not over bake the cookies.</strong> </li>
    <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5-10 minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    <li>Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 5-7 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.</li>
